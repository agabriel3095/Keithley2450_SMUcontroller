# Keithley2450_SMUcontroller
This project controls a Source Measurement Unit (SMU) for voltage and current measurements using pyvisa. It includes features like voltage ramping with safety checks, real-time monitoring of current and voltage, and power management (on/off). The project also provides a terminal-based live update of SMU parameters using rich.
